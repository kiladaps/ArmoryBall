#### Background

- First attempt at creating an iOS application

- Sophmore year of college (2015)

- Prior experience: None

- Good luck getting it to run (Outdated API / Swift 2)

#### Project Conception:

The goal of this project was to create my first ios application, learning swift in the process, and to help solve a problem that many of my friends and I face at school. I love to play basketball at my school, and as many others do as well. The problem we face however, is that people are never sure how many people are currently playing, and players are afraid of showing up to play basketball at an empty gym. This causes many players to not show up altogether and hurts the pickup experience during the school year. To solve this problem, I set out to create an application to allow users to login when they reach the gym. This way, anyone wanting to come play basketball could see a live count of the number of players partaking. With this, the app would alsoincentivize players to want to sign in as well, by crediting them with points. So the more you played, the more points you earned. As points are acquired, you can then also wager points in friendly games such as 1 v 1 or whatever the players please. There would be a leaderboard of the top ten players with the most points. The player with the most points would have his profile displayed at every player's login, giving major incentive to be number one and hopefully increasing the novelty of the app.

#### Application Walkthrough:

- Due to the constant updates to swift, and the recent shutdown of the backend service I used to run the application Parse, there is currently no working version of the application. However, live screenshots were taken and are displayed below with a walkthrough of the app.

- When the user opens the application for the first time, they would be met with a tutorial screen explaining the purpose of the app and how to use it. This screen would only appear one time, and was never fully completed, as only 2 pages were made, as shown below.

- The user would then be met with a login screen where they could login with their current username and password, or create a new account. When creating an account, a user would be asked for a full name and a valid RPI email address that also matches with their name. After this, the user would be asked to upload an image of themselves for their user profile and the setup would be complete. The login screen can be seen below.

- Once the user is logged in, they will be met at the home screen of the application, which can be seen below. There are many options for the user to explore, which include, how many people are currently at the basketball courts, how many want partake in a pickup game, a refresh button, and a banner ad using Google Adsense. Users are also met with numerous buttons that allow them to login, send messages in a chat within the app, bet their points, contact me, check leaderboards, check the schedule of the available times of the court, and logout. This home screen can be seen below.

- Finally, when the user would go to login, a temporary full screen ad would pop up, and once dismissed by the user, they would be met at the login screen to choose one of the two options seen below, along with seeing the profile of the number one user.
